If you take the option to add a total or missing values, or if the variable is categorical, the table created will have several columns.\nSeries ID: this is an auto-populate field; each row in this table is automatically assigned a series ID, which is an incremental value (1). This ID is used in particular to define graphs.\nSection: this is a free field which can be used to combine analyses on a theme in a single table, for example patient characteristics over time.

It is also possible to leave this field empty, and define the analysis solely on the basis of a formula in the “Summary function” field.\nTitle (header): this is a calculated field. It is the name which will be displayed at the top of the table, above the corresponding analyses. It is made up of the summary label (described below), the label of the time variable (row) and the label of the variable to be analysed (Group by variable (column)).\nAdd missing data: this is a yes/no field which allows you to indicate whether you want to count missing data for the selected variable. If “yes” is selected, a column with the missing values will be added to the right of the other columns created for each mode of the variable to be analysed.\nSummary function: this is a free field in which to enter the formula corresponding to the desired analysis. The formula must always be written without the “=” sign and in English, whatever the language in which the setup file is written (see formula).\nOften the aim is to show the distribution of patients between the modalities of a variable, and the “N” function is sufficient.

The blue pieces are vlist1D variables that were defined for that linelist (in the Info sheet, hence their suffixes).\nThis name specification will result in the following export names, depending on where the linelist is used (hence depending on how they filled the metadata):\n\nMNG_linelist__MNG24__SSD__MSF-OCP__Aweil__anonyme__vb-1003__20240617-1901.xlsb if the linelist was used by OCP in Aweil (South Sudan)\nMNG_linelist__MNG24__NER__WaCa__Maradi__anonyme__vb-2035__20240617-1903.xlsb if the linelist was used by WaCa in Maradi (Niger)\n…\n\nNote: if a variable is referred to in the name but remains empty in the linelist, the name of the variable is used as a placeholder. In the example above, if the data encoder filled none of the variables in the metadata, the created file would have the following name:\nMNG_linelist__info_outbreak_code__info_country_code__info_organisation__info_facility_name__anonyme__vb-1003__20240617-1906.xlsb"

In this case, the tables should at minima be linked by a key.\nExample of a user case:\n\na main data entry sheet with general patient data (e.g. a Patient linelist sheet)\na secondary entry sheet with additional variables for a subset of patients (e.g. readmission variables or extensive lab testing).\n\nIn this case, the natural way to link the tables is to have the ID of the patient in both tables.\n\nConstrain possibles values for patient IDs in the secondary table with list_auto\nIn the user case above, the patients from the Readmission sheet are a subset from the Patient linelist sheet so we expect the IDs from Readmission to match the ones from Patient linelist.\nThe minimal (unsafe) option is to have two free text patient ID columns, one in each table, where data encoders enter IDs manually. This process however increases the risk of typing error and thus of merging nightmare.\nA safer way is to create a categorical variable in the Readmission sheet whose dropdown menu is populated by values present in the case_id column of the Patient linelist sheet. As the data encoder can only choose from existing patients from the Patient linelist sheet, the opportunity for encoding error and thus unmatched patients is greatly reduced.3\n\n\n\nUse of list_auto to link two columns\n\n\nSeethe section on list_auto and its control for a description on how to use the list_auto control.\n\n\nImport values from the other table with VALUE_OF\nIn addition to key columns to be able to join the tables, it might be desirable to bring some of the patient data in the secondary table, to calculate new variables, or just to facilitate reading and understanding without having fill the value on each line.\nFor example, we might want to bring in the name and surname of the patient, without entering it again, or the date of exit, to be able to calculate the number of days between the exit of the first admission and the date of readmission.\nThe custom function VALUE_OF can do that. It works sort of like a LOOKUP function, except we provide variable names, and it matches the value you need.\nIt takes three arguments, all variable names:\n\nVALUE_OF(key_variable1, key_variable2, variable_values)\n\n\nkey_variable1: the list_auto in the current sheet (the key column that contains IDs, e.g. readmission_id)\n\n\nkey_variable2: the source of the list_auto in the other sheet (the IDs from the main sheet, e.g. case_id)\n\n\nvariable_values: the variable which values we want to import.\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of the use of VALLUE_OF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nkey_variable2 and variable_values must be on the same sheet or the function will return nothing.\n\n\nThe function matches the values from columns key_variable1 and key_variable2, and returns values from variable_values column at the corresponding row.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf the function finds more than two matches, it will return the values from the first match (the first line found)."

By opposition, variable labels can change or be translated.\nVariable names are used to migrate data from one linelist file to the other: changing the variable name of a variable in the setup is equivalent to creating a new variable: the migration script will not be able to match the variables.\n\n\nVariable names rules:\n\nNames must be unique in the setup file, even if the variables are on different sheets.\n\nNames must be at least 4 characters long to be valid.\n\nNames should not contain special characters (except for “_”).\n\nNames will be automatically converted to lower-case during compilation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAs a general advice, try to create short but explicit names (easier said than done).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo ensure that variable names are unique, you can add the name of the sheet in which the variable will appear as a prefix, or use numbers.\nIf by error two or more variables have the same name, the second occurrence will automatically be suffixed with the value “1”; if there is a third, it will be suffixed with the value “2”, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe recommend that you do not leave any blanks in the variable name. Instead, replace them with “_”.\n\n\n\n\nMain Label\nThis is a free text field that defines the variables labels, which are quick descriptions of the variables, which the linelist user can read. They are typically more descriptive and longer than names, but we recommend to keep them moderately short for legibility reasons.\nIn the linelist, the main label appears in black and bold. It cannot be modified by the end user (with one exception, see Section 0.1.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo add more details, you can use the following fields: “Sub Label” and “Note” (see below).\n\n\n\n\nDev Comment\nThis free text column is for the sole benefit of the setup file developer (in all probability, you), to add technical or practical information. It is not read by the designer and does not affect the generated file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOne of the author of this doc uses these tags:\n\nFormat: calculated columns created for applying conditional formatting (see Section 5.3). These columns are very specific, and pure format. Tagging them helps to quickly make sure that they are never exported\nMoH: columns created when a general setup is adapted to a specific MoH format by adding a dedicated export for that format. Usually, we need to create some calculated columns that match the MoH export (recoding levels, or perhaps merging information of several variables…). I like to keep track of which columns are from the general setup and which are specific adaptations.\nWHO/Epinetwork: sometimes I want to keep the information that a column is here because it comes from the Epinetwork or the WHO CRF, and should probably not be modified.\nBoilerplate: calculated columns that are needed for graphs, or because the information is important (such as epiweeks). These columns are often hidden, but not necessarily, and they sometimes can be exported too.\n\n\n\nFeel free to use this column in a ways that helps you work, or ignore it!\n\n\nEditable Label\nThis is a yes/no column. If the value is “yes”, the label of the variable in the linelist can be modified by its user. If the value is “no” or if the field remains empty, the variable label in the linelist is protected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt is often desirable to add a couple of columns with editable labels at the end of the linelist, in case the user want to collect some extra information. It gives some freedom to users to collect some site specific data without needing an update of the setup. When I do that, I usually provide a couple of free text variables, and a couple of customisable dropdonws variables (see Section 3.0.0.0.3)\n\n\n\n\nSub Label\nThis is a free text field used to add a brief description under the variable label, such as the format in which a date is expected, a unit, or any other information to help with filling the variable in.\nIn the linelist, the sub-label appears just below the main label, in blue and slightly smaller font. It cannot be modified by the end user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe sub-labels “Calculated” and “Custom dropdown” are added automatically, no need to add them manually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCommon sub-labels include the following:\n\nYes / No\nYes / No / Unk.\nFree text\nThe format of your date (ex: DD/MM/YYYY)\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\nThis is a free text field which content is added to the linelist as a comment on the corresponding cell. The comment in the linelist can be read by hovering the cursor over the cell. It cannot be modified by the end user.\n\n\nExample\nDefinitions in the setup file:\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay in the linelist file:"

There are two options:\n\nvlist1D1: corresponds to a table built vertically, so the variables labels are in the same column, and only one entry is expected for each variable. This structure of data is well adapted to collect metadata about the health structure, the project or the data collection itself.\nhlist2D2: corresponds to a horizontally constructed table, so the variables labels appear in the same row, and several entries are possible for each variable. This type of sheet is used to collect patient data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Section\nThis is a free text field used to define the name of the main section in which the variable is located. This makes it possible to group variables by theme to make data entry and navigation easier.\nIn the linelist file, the main sections appear in a darker colour in rows or columns, depending on the type of table (dark blue in Section 0.2.5). They cannot be modified by the end user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo make the dictionary easier to read, we recommend that you group (write one below another) the variables of a same sheet and a same section.\n\n\n\n\nSub Section\nThis is a free text field that allows you to further refine the organisation of variables in the table by creating a second level of grouping.\nIn the linelist file, the sub-sections appear in a lighter colour in the row or column, depending on the type of table (light blue in Section 0.2.5).

    "text": "Properties\nThe properties section of the table controls variable visibility, uniqueness, and the type and format of the variable (what it contains, in which form, and in which display).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus\nThis is a dropdown field that contains four options for defining the visibility of the variable. The linelist has a functionality to show or hide optional variables depending on the data needs on the field.\n\nmandatory: variable displayed by default, it cannot be hidden in the linelist\noptional, visible: variable displayed by default, it can be displayed or hidden by the linelist user\noptional, hidden: variable hidden by default, it can be displayed or hidden by the linelist user\nhidden: variable hidden by default, it cannot be displayed in the linelist^[Technically, the linelist user can force the columns to unhide, which is actually very usefull to test and debug your nascent linelist. This visibility setting will however not be migrated.]\n\nVariables can be shown or hidden using the Show/Hide button in the linelist file.\n\nExample\nDefinition in the setup file:\n\nDisplay in the linelist file:\n\n\n“Mandatory” variables in the setup file appear as “Mandatory” in the “Show/Hide” pop up, and cannot be hidden.\n1\nThe “optional, hidden” variables in the setup file appear as “Hidden” (by default). However, the user can change the status by choosing “Show”, in which case the column will become visible. \n2 \n3\nThe “Notification year” variable does not appear in the list of variables because it is in “hidden” status in the setup file.\nThe “optional, visible” variables in the setup file appear as “Displayed” (by default). However, you can change the status by choosing “Hide”, in which case the column will no longer be visible.\n4 \n\n\n\nRegister Book\nThis is a yes/no dropdown menu field used to predefine the variables to be included in the register to be printed. This step is not mandatory and can be managed later, directly in the linelist file.\n\n\nPersonal Identifier\nThis is a yes/no dropdown menu field that indicates that the variable contains personal data (such as names, phone numbers etc.).\nThis column has to uses:\n\nit allows the setup developer to quickly identify variables containing personal data in its dictionary\n\nit is used to remove variables automatically from the exports if such a behaviour is needed (see the Exports sheet).\n\n\n\nThinking about variables\nThere are many ways of thinking about variables and of classifying them.\nIn general we can distinguished between input variables, where the user enters raw data, and calculated (or derived) variables, which require no input. Both of them can be created in OutbreakTools.\nIndependently of this distinction, a variety of variables types can exist, containing numbers or text in various forms. In Excel, we will often use the types integer, decimals, dates and text.3. See the section on Section 0.3.5 for more information.\nFor input variables, you could think of two ways of entering data: a “free” approach, where user can enter the value of their choice, and a controlled (constrained) approach, where the values the user can enter are limited. In Excel, this is generally implemented through dropdown menus from which the data encoder selects a value. In OutbreakTools, there have several ways of building dropdown menus, depending on whether you know the categories in advance or not. This is what we call “variable control”. Learn more about it in the Section 0.3.7.\nFinally, many software allow the user to set the way the data is displayed, which we here call format. For example:\n- The date first of January of 2023 can be displayed as “01/01/2024”, or “1/1/24” or 1-Jan-24” etc.\n- The number “1” could be displayed as “1” simply, or “001”\n- The number 0.01 could be displayed with different levels of rounding, or even as “10%” if the column contains proportions that can be displayed as percentages.\nLearn more about format in Section 0.3.6\n\n\nVariable Type\n\nThis column proposes a dropdown menu field containing four options for defining the type [^which is sometimes called class in some softwares] of each variable:\n\nText: creates a column of text [^also called character string in some softwares]. The entry of the text may be free or constrained by a dropdown menu, see the Section 0.3.7 section below.\nDate: creates a date column, whose exact format is defined in the next column, Section 0.3.6. The default format is jj-mmm-aaaa.\nInteger: creates an integer column\nDecimal: creates a column with decimal numbers. The number of digits after the decimal point is defined in the following Section 0.3.6 column.\n\n\n\n\nVariable Format\n\nThis field is used to specify the format of the variable (which depends on its type).\nThere is a predefined dropdown list with common options, but you can enter any format by hand, as long as it is written in Excel syntax.\n\nExample: for an integer to appear with at least 2 characters, enter the format: # #00\nNote that the default data format is jj-mmm-aaaa.\n\n\nControl\n\nThis is a dropdown field containing nine options for defining variables that are not simple free entry variables:\n\nchoice_manual\nchoice_custom\nchoice_multiple\nlist_auto\ngeo\nhf\nformula\ncase_when\nchoice_formula\n\nThese options can be broadly classified in three sorts of variables to be created:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSort of variable\nControls\nData entry in the linelist\n\n\n\n\nCategorical\nchoice_manual, choice_custom, choice_multiple, list_auto\nDropdown menu\n\n\nGeo-related columns (a special case of categorical)\ngeo, hf\nGeoHelper or dropdown menu\n\n\nCalculated\nformula, choice_formula, case_when\nNo user input needed in these columns\n\n\n\n\n\nDropdown menu variables\nThis table summarises the different options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\ncho ice_manual\nHow\nto populat e the drop down menu?\nPredefined values\nWhe\nre are valu es defined?\nSetup file, in the “Choice” sheet\nData entry in the linelist | =========== ==== ==== ==== == =========== ==== ==== ==== == =========== ==== ==== ==== == ==========+ One value selected from a dropdown menu |\n\n\nchoic e_multiple\nPredefined values\nSetup file, in the “Choice” sheet\nSeveral values selected from a dropdown menu |\n\n\ncho ice_custom\nUs er-defined values (but see details)\nLinelist file, in the “Custom dropdown” sheet\nOne value selected from a dropdown menu |\n\n\nlist_auto\nUs er-defined values but from another data column | Linelist file, in another column | One value, selected from a dropdown populated by the values of another variable\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoice_manual\nThis control creates a categorical variable with a static dropdown menu in the linelist, from which one value can be selected. The authorised values from the dropdown menu are defined in advance in the setup and cannot be modified by the users of the linelist (hence the “static”).\nIn the setup file, we define these values in a list stored in the “Choices” sheet, and fill the name of that list in the column “Control details” column (see Section 3.0.1 section).\n\n\nChoice_multiple\nThis control is similar to the choice manual, in that it creates a static dropdown menu in the linelist from predefined values entered in the setup.\nThe difference is that in the created linelist file, the user can use the dropdown menu several times to select multiple values. These values will be concatenated and stored as a chain of character. By default, the separator is a coma (“,”), but you can modify this in the control column. For example, entering choice_multiple(“_”) would use the character “_” to separate values instead of “,”.\nExample: if the user select “Azythromicin”, then “Ampicilin” from a dropdown menu, the value “Azythromicin, Ampicilin” will be stored in the cell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA choice_multiple column cannot be used in the Analyses sheets as the designer cannot predict the number of combinations the user will create, and thus cannot create tables with appropriate size.\n\n\n\n\nChoice_custom\nThis control creates a dynamic dropdown menu in the linelist, but contrary to the previous controls, the values are not (necessarily) predefined in the setup, but instead defined by the user. This control is useful for variables where one would like to enforce standardization of values, but the values to encode are not known in advance.\nExample: you wish to create a column containing the name of facilities patients can be transferred to. The names of these facilities is site dependent, thus unknown in advance.\nUsing the choice_custom control will create a table in the “Custom dropdown” sheet in the linelist where the user can fill-in values to populate the dynamic, customised dropdown menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhile by default the dropdown menu created is empty, it is possible to prefill it by filling the “Control Details” column with a list of choices, like for the other types of dropdowns menus (see Section 3.0.1 section). The table in the “Custom dropdown” sheet of the linelist will still created and future users will be able to modify/grow it.\n\n\n\n\nList_auto\nThis control also creates a dynamic dropdown menu, but the values come from the data entered in another column.\nExample: a linelist contains two data-entry sheets: - the first data entry sheet contains patient data\n- a second data entry sheet contains more variables for a subset of re-admitted patients.\nThe list_auto control allows to create a column on the second sheet with a dropdown menu populated dynamically with the patient IDs from the first sheet.\nIn the setup, the variable used to populate the dropdown menu is defined in the “Control Details” column of the Dictionary sheet (see Section 3.0.1 section).\n\n\n\nSpecial case of amdinistrative levels and health facilities\nTwo controls allow us to enter geographic information, or information about health facilities. While the created variables will technically contain dropdown menus, they are treated as a special type of variables in OubtbreakTools linelists, with dedicated tools and analyses.\nOutbreakTool linelists all have a button to import a geobase, a standardised file containing lists of administrative levels to describe places. Once the geobase successfully imported, the values from its lists will populate specific dropdown menus (see the linelist documentation on how to import a geobase).\n\nGeo\nThe “geo” control indicates that geographic data is expected. In the linelist, this results in the creation of 4 columns, one for each administrative level, which will be populated by values imported from a geobase. The user can enter data by using the GeoHelper button in the linelist or by selecting values from the cascading dropdown menus in the linelist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe “geo” control does not need additional information to be filled in the “Control Details” column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the linelist, the variable labels appear in an orange cell, which means that the “GeoHelper” button can be used to fill in the corresponding cells.\n\n\nExample:\nDefinition in the setup file:\n\nDisplay in the linelist file:\n\n\n\nHF\nThe “hf” control means that the user will enter en health facility. By identifying hf data in this way, you can use the GeoHelper button in the linelist to fill in the column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSimilarly to the “geo” control, the “hf” control does not need additional information to be filled in the “Control Details” column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe variable label appears in an orange cell, which means that the GeoHelper button can be used to fill in the corresponding cells.\n\n\nExample:\nDefinition in the setup file:\n\nDisplay in the linelist :\n\n\n\n\nCalculated variables\nThree controls allow the creation of calculated columns. In general, the user can define a column by providing an Excel formula [^i.e. a combination of Excel functions], but the setup file also provides two custom functions, CASE_WHEN and CHOICE_FORMULA to simplify formula syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\nF u nctions\nUse\nDefault value\nCan be used in a nalyses tables\n\n\n\n\nformula\nAny c o m b ination of Excel f u nctions (in E nglish)\nA nything\n\nC o n tinuous v a r iables: yes\nC a t e gorical v a r iables: no\n\n\nc a se_when\n**C A S E _WHEN** (Excel f u nctions o p tional)\nR eplaces nested IF\nEmpty cell; user can modify it\nno\n\n\nchoi c e _ formula\n**CH OICE _FO R M ULA** (Excel f u nctions o p tional)\nR eplaces nested IF\nEmpty c h a racter; user cannot modify it\nyes\n\n\n\n\nFormula\nWhen using the “formula” control, the value displayed is calculated according to a formula defined in the Control details column of the dictionary.\n\n\nCase_when\nVariables of control “case_when” use a specifically developed function, CASE_WHEN, which replaces a succession of nested IF. While you could write the formula with nested IF, CASE_WHEN is easier to read, thus simpler to use.\nCase usage: you want to recode a variable, but you do not know which values will be generated. For example, the raw data contains a columns for the age value and a column for the age unit. You use CASE_WHEN to create a column “age_years”. The values which will be present in the column can take many decimal value in the range of reasonable ages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nCategorical variable created with this control cannot be used in univariate or bivariate tables in analyses sheets, because we cannot know in advance how many modalities the variable will take, and thus the designer cannot construct the tables.\nOn the other hand, numeric variables created with this control [^(such as age in years)] can be summarised in the analyses. Indeed, taking the average or the median of a numeric variable variable will always output one value, so the designer knows what to expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf the variable is not identified with a “case_when” control, and you still use the function in the “formula” column, Excel will not be able to return the desired result because the function is not native.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are using a recent version of Excel, you may know the functions IFS or SWITCH. Outbreak Tools does not rely on them as they are not retro compatible with some older versions of Excel. Use a CASE_WHEN or CHOICE_FORMULA instead.\n\n\nRead more about writing the formula in the Control details column of the dictionary.\n\n\nChoice_formula\nThis control indicates the use of the CHOICE_FORMULA function, another custom function to create a calculated column. This function is a special case of the CASE_WHEN formula with more constrains on it. In this case, the values that the calculated variable can take are known in advance and predefined in the “Choices” sheet.\nColumns generated with this control can be used in univariate or bivariate tables, as the number of possible categories is known in advance.\nRead more about writing the formula in the Control details column of the dictionary.\n\n\n\n\nControl details\nThis is a free text field, which accepts three types of values: - the name of a list (defined in the Choices sheet), - the name or a variable (defined in the Dictionary sheet) - a formula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCont\nrol type\nStatic dropdown menu\nContro\nl column\nchoice _manual, choice custom, choice multiple\nValue expected in the “Control details” column | ==== ==== ============== ====== ===== ==== ==== ============== ====== ===== ==== ==== ============== ====== ===== ==== ==== =============+ The name of a list that contains the authorised values, defined in the Choice sheet (“List Name” column) |\n\n\n\n\nDynamic dropdown menu\nlist_auto\nThe name of an existing v ariable\n\n\nCa lculated\nformula, choice_ formula, c ase_when\nAn Excel formula (that can contain one or more functions, including the custom functions CASE_WHEN and C HOICE_FORMULA)\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining dropdown menu categories\nWhen the controls “choice_manual”, “choice_multiple” and “choice_custom” (optional) are selected in the “Control” column, you need to define the values the dropdown menu will contain. These values are entered on another sheet, the Choices sheet. Categories for a same variable are bundled into lists. The name of the list is entered in the “Control details” column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor more information on the definition of dropdown menus, see the Choices sheet page.\n\n\nIn the case of “list auto” variables, you only need to provide the name of another variable in the “Control details” column. In the linelist, the values present in the referred variables will be automatically used to populate the dropdown menu.\n\n\nFormulas\nIf you have selected “formula”, “choice_formula” or “case_when” in the “Control” column, you need to provide the formula to be applied in this column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe information given in the Formula control section below are also valid for “choice_formula” and “case_when” controls as these, while based on custom functions, are still formulas.\n\n\n\nFormula control\nThe formula is written in English, without an “=” sign. The formulas are automatically translated into the Excel language defined on the computer used to generate the linelist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf your Excel is not usually in English, pay special attention to the following:\n\nUse the English function names, such as “MEAN” instead of “MOYENNE”, or “IF” instead of “SI”.\nFunction arguments are separated by “,” in English. Beware of lingering “;” if you are used to Excel in French!\nSimilarly, English Excel uses “.” for decimals, not “,” like in French.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn Excel, you can use ALT+ENTRY to insert a carriage return and go to the next line. This does not affect the execution of your formulas, but greatly increases the readability. The same goes for inserting spaces around operators. Contrast these two formulas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen writing a formula, make sure that it returns an empty value for rows without an ID, as all the rows with non-null values in it will be counted in the Analyses sheets. If your graphs show a lot of “Missing” values that do not reflect how well a column is filled, check that a calculated column is not responsible for it.\n\n\n\n\nCase_when control\nUse the CASE_WHEN function to replace nested IF (therefore limiting the risk of error when writing the formula), in this form:\n\nCASE_WHEN( condition1, value1, condition2, value2, condition3, value3, …, …, DEFAULT_VALUE)\n\nYou need at least one pair of conditions but the function shines when there are many pairs. As in the nested IF or in the IFS functions, the conditional statement are tested in the order they are written. By default, any case that is not covered by the previous conditions will return an empty cell, unless you provide a default value (the else).\nExample\nYou could write a formula with nested IF to calculate an age_years column:\n\nIF(age_unit = “months”, age_value / 12, IF(age_unit = “days”, age_value / 365, IF(age_unit = “years”, age_value, IF(ISBLANK(age_unit), ““))))\n\nOr write the equivalent with CASE_WHEN:\n\nCASE_WHEN( age_unit = “months”, age_value / 12, age_unit = “days”, age_value / 365, age_unit = “years”, age_value)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe information about the more generalist “formula” control are also valid here.\n\n\n\n\nChoice_formula control\nThe CHOICE_FORMULA function is a subcase of CASE_WHEN for when we want to encode a few known modalities.\nThe pseudo-code is very similar to the CASE_WHEN function:\n\nCHOICE_FORMULA(list_values_choices, condition1, value1, condition2, value2, condition3, value3, …, … )\n\nBut here, the value1, value2, value3 etc. are pre-defined in the list “list_values_choices” in the “Choices” sheet, as if these values were for a dropdown menu 4.\nSince we know exactly which modalities this variable can take, we can use it as a categorical variable in the Analyses sheet, to build a uni or a bivariate table.\nExample:\n\nCHOICE_FORMULA(list_age_group, age_years &lt; 5, “0 – 4 years”, age_years &lt; 10, “5 – 9 years, age_years &lt; 15,”10 – 14 years, age_years &lt; 20, “15 – 19 years, AND(age_years &gt;= 20, age_years &lt; 120),”20+ years” )\n\nHere, “list_age_group” corresponds to the list where the potential values to be returned are predefined; “age_years” is an existing variable that contains the age in years. The values between inverted commas (“0 – 5 years”) correspond to the possible results, predefined in “list_age_group”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe information about the more generalist “formula” control are also valid here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique\nThis is a yes/no dropdown menu field. It has no direct impact on the linelist, but the information can be used in the data cleaning phase."
