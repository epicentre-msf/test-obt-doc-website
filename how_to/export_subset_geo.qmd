title: "Export a subset of geographic columns"
---

The need: you need to create a MoH export with only the admin 3 and 4 columns.

The problem: in the **set-up file** *Dictionary* sheet, geographic columns are represented by one *"geo" variable*, that is translated in 4 columns in the generated **linelist file** (admin 1, 2, 3 and 4) with cascading dropdown menus. In the **set-up file**, if you indicate that this "geo" variable should be exported for a given export, the linelist export will contain the 4 admin levels columns (more if you choose to export p-codes, see the "*Exports*" sheet options in the **set-up file**).

The solution: you need to derive individual columns from the automatically created "*geo*" columns, and exports these only to your MoH export.

How does it works? The "*geo*" variable **name** is used to automatically name the 4 level columns in the linelist. For example, if the "*geo*" variable in the **set-up file** is called "*origin*", four columns will be created in the linelist: adm1\_*origin*, adm2\_*origin*, adm3\_*origin*, adm4\_*origin*.

**Even though these columns do not appear in the setup file, they will be created in the linelist!** This means that you can reference them and use them in formulas in other parts of the *Dictionary* sheet, like you would do for any other variable defined in that sheet.

An example, with a column named "residence": the green variable is the "geo" variable. It triggers the creation of 4 columns in the linelist. You will export it for a MSF export, but maybe you don't need to export all the fours columns in an MoH export. The blue variables are calculated variables (formula control) that refer to the geo columns that are automatically created. You can decide for each of these individually to export them or not in a given export.

Because the variable do not appear in the **setup file**, the *checkRep* *check* will raise a warning, saying that the formula will fail (because it references a variable that seem not to exist), but in this specific instance, it is wrong, **the columns will be created**, and the formula will thus work in the linelist.
