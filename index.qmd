**OutbreakTools** is a set of solutions designed by [Epicentre](https://epicentre.msf.org/) [EpiDS team](https://apps.epicentre-msf.org/public/) to quickly create linelists to collect field data during outbreaks. These linelists have a number of functionalities including descriptive analyses, buttons to migrate data to or from the linelist, or to import geographic data to better describe locations.


**OutbreakTools** allow you to quickly develop these linelists without the need for advanced Excel skills or ad-hoc development, by creating a (glorified) dictionary and compiling it. If you have ever built a Kobo form or a Redcap database from a dictionary, this might sound familiar.
