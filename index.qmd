**OutbreakTools** is a set of solutions designed by [Epicentre](https://epicentre.msf.org/) [EpiDS team](https://apps.epicentre-msf.org/public/) to quickly create linelists to collect field data during outbreaks. These linelists have a number of functionalities including descriptive analyses, buttons to migrate data to or from the linelist, or to import geographic data to better describe locations.


OutbreakTools allow you to quickly develop these linelists without the need for advanced Excel skills or ad-hoc development, by creating a dictionary and compiling it. If you have ever built a Kobo or a Redcap database from a dictionary, this might sound familiar.
