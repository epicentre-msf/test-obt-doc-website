title: "Create dictionary"
---



Take an empty setup file



1.  **Create the data dictionary**: go back and forth, filling the *Dictionary* and *Choices* sheets to define the data entry sheets of the linelist (at minima a metadata sheet and a main linelist sheet)
2.  **Define the exports**: define the number of exports you want and their metadata on the *Exports* sheet, and fill the dedicated Export columns in the *Dictionary* sheet
3.  **Define the analyses** in the *Analysis* sheet
4.  **Add new translations** if you wish to, in the *Translations* sheet

You can check for errors between any of these steps (see the "OutbreakTools" ribbon section of this document)

5.  Generate the linelist thanks to the **designer file**. Test it.
6.  Repeat steps 1 to 5 until the linelist works as expected. The rest of this guide will walk you through the sheets, the tables in it and the ribbon buttons.
