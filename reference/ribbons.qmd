### Advanced {#sec-advanced}

![OutbreakTools tab in the designer](images/img-003-ribbon-setup-advanced.png){fig-align="center"}

#### Check current setup for errors {#sec-check-setup}

The **setup file** comes with a series of checks on its content to help you debug your dictionary. After adding major components to your **setup file**, or before compiling a linelist with the designer, you ~~can~~ should click on the button "*Check current setup for errors*" to see any errors in the *"\_\_checkRep*" sheet.

There is a table for each sheet or section (in the case of analyses), with the following three columns:

-   "**Incoherences Type**" preceded by the name of the sheet,  

-   "**Where?**", which shows the name of the sheet or section and the line where the incoherence is located,  

-   "**Details**", which gives details of the incoherence.


There are several types information that could appear in the Incoherence column:

-   **Info** (in grey): this is not an inconsistency, but simply a piece of information about something that will not block the compilation of the linelist.    

-   **Warning** (in yellow): these are problems that need to be fixed because there is a real inconsistency or problem. It could be an error in a formula, for example.^[Note that the checkup does its best, but some formula errors can be missed and create problems in your formulas. Always test the calculated columns after compilation!]  

-   **Note** (in blue): this is something that has been defined in the setup, but will not be applied, and is therefore not blocking. For example, in the analyses, certain choices are contradictory by design, such as the display of percentages, which is not authorised when you choose to invert the display of the table (horizontal display instead of vertical).

### Imports

#### Import translations

If the user wishes to modify the linelist interface translations, it is possible to ask for the config file to EpiDS/Yves Amevoin, tweak it and import it with this button.

#### Import passwords

The designer is loaded with a pasword table, with private and public keys to protect export if the user want a password-protected export. However, the designer is on Github, in a public repo, so if you compile a linelist that needs a password protection, it is best to ask for the config file to EpiDS/Yves Amevoin and import it using the "Import button".

#### Import styles {#sec-setup-styles}

The designer comes with two default styles for linelist themes. It is possible to personalise it. To do that, ask for the config file to EpiDS/Yves Amevoin, tweak it and import it with this button.
